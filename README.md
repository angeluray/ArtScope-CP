# ArtScope

This is Artscope, a HTML/CSS and JS based website for a photography institution that mix photography with astronomy and teach students from all around the world spacial photography. For creating this web I have set up linters such as:

- `Lighthouse`: that gives me global performance insights about the page with a single test.
- `Webhint`: that helped me improve the site's accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility, and more.
- `Stylelinter`: that helped to avoid errors and enforce CSS conventions. 

The overall style and positioning was made using pure CSS, following Flexbox and Grid layout models simultaneously.

## Built With
